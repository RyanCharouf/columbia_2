# AI Bootcamp Experience So Far

So far I have been enjoying the bootcamp. It is a new challenge that seems pretty interesting and it is something I can use in the future as well. It's only been 3 days and I know it's going to get more difficult but I am expited for the challenge.

# Day 1

This is a list of things we did on day 1 of class:
1. Got a good overview of the couse.
2. Use the Terminal for the first time
3. Got confused like 15 times but was interested

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The first was, although new and a bit confising, is going to get a lot harder in the next couple of weeks.

## Here are a couple of commands I learned so far

```sh
pwd
cd
mkdir
touch
git clone
git add *
git push
```
